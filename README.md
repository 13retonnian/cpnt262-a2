## Problems I ran into:
- Need to make hamburger menu nav bar. 
- I used the code from my old assignment and it has a ton of mistakes in it and I probably should have just started from scratch.
- I need to change the size of the images so they aren't so huge and slow to load.
- The old images I used didn't have enough information in them so I had to get all new images.
- It was very difficult to get the images to look nice inside a grid because they are all different sizes so I put them all in cards.
- The images are most beautiful in their original size so I made them link to their original URL. I feel like the small images are doing a discredit to the beauty of the originals.
